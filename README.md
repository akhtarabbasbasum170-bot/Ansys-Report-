This repository contains the ANSYS Workbench project and documentation for Static Structural and Transient (Explicit) Structural analyses performed on a hexagonal mechanical component. The objective of this work is to evaluate stress distribution, deformation behavior, and mesh convergence under both static and time-dependent loading conditions, following instructor-defined rules for material properties and applied forces.

The geometry was created and simulation is done in ANSYS Workbench.
